    <h1>What worked well for you over the last 9 weeks that aided in your learning process?</h1>
    <p>personal one on one time and just trial and error. I learn best by doing.</p>
    <h2>What would you change about the course?</h2>
    <p>I would add video links for each lesson just incase someone is trying to do something on their own time and can't figure out an issue.</p>
    <h2>Did you learn what you expected to learn in this course?</h2>
    <p>That and so much more. I never thought I'd even learn how to make a Website, now it's something else i can add to my list of knowledge I can use in my business.</p>
    <h2>What concepts were new to you and what concepts had you already encountered in the past?</h2>
    <p>Everything was new to me because I have never touch or interacted with websites before, what stood out to me the most, bootstrap and CSS. It's almost like it does the work for you, you just pick out what you want and having a sheet made just for decorations makes keeping everything organized.</p>
